## My name is Nikita Chernyak and this is the first time I'm writing a CV! *(So, please don't judge strictly :)*

I'm a 19-year-old student from Belarus. I graduated from school in 2018 and entered the Belarusian State University. At present I'm in my 2nd year of studying at the Faculty of Radiophysics and Computer Technologies, and I can say I am completely satisfied with my choice of university. I like studying, getting new information, learning various subjects. So far my favourite ones are mathematical analysis, differential equations and, of course, programming. I started learning programming with `C++`. It wasn't an easy thing to do, but now I understand it was worth it. `C++` is a great language to start with if you want to figure out how things work. At present I am learning `Java` at the university. I should say that our lecturer is a highly educated specialist, whose lections are always interesting and informative. 

Not so long ago I decided to explore new fields of programming. Firstly I tried myself in frontend development. I started learning `HTML, CSS` and `JavaScript` but pretty soon I got bored, I felt like it wasn't something I would like to do, and I continued searching. After some time I came to the conclusion that I want to be an Android developer. I want to make Android programs, I want to know how this OS works, how its architecture is built and so on. One of the first steps I took was getting on Android Development course from Rolling Scopes School. Now I'm starting to learn `Kotlin`, `Git for Android Developers`, `Android Studio IDE`. I hope this course will help me to get basic understanding of this operating system and acquire the necessary skills for for application development. In my turn, I'm ready to spend much time and effort on self-education and complete given tasks as good as I can.

Speaking about my English practice, I studied English at school for 11 years, and I can say I pretty much succeeded in it. Since the 5th grade, I have participated in school, regional and even republican olympiads, and I always occupied prize-winning places. At present I keep learning the language as I understand that it will help me a lot in future life and career. I regularly do tests, watch videos and listen to music in English. Tests usually determine my level of English as B2 (sometimes C1).
